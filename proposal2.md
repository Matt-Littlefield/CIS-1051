# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Pokemon Battle Simulator

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My project will allow the user to simulate a pokemon battle against a computer controlled opponent.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

It will start with an intro screen where you click a start button, which will bring you to the selection screen. At this selection screen you will decide which pokemon you will use, as well as its moves. You will also be able to select your opponent and its moves. You will then click a button that will bring you to the next screen which will be the actual battle screen. At this point, you will participate in a traditional pokemon battle where you will select a move to use each turn, while your opponent does the same. Once the battle concludes, you will return back to the selection screen.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

At the bare minimum I want to make a battle simulator where you can use about 5 pokemon (probably some assortment of starter pokemon, pikachu, etc.).

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be a battle simulator where you can use a significant amount of pokemon (original 151 pokemon, only pokemon with 500+ total base stats, etc.).

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

If everything goes well I would like to add a multiplayer functionality, where you can battle against someone on an entirely different device.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to learn how to create and edit different windows and screens (I referenced the hurricane tracker and have been trying to learn the tkinter toolkit), and if I do get some sort of online functionality I will have to have learned how to do that because I have little to no idea at the moment.
